## Overview

### Strategic Approach

BRSPP follows a phased corporate structure strategy designed to minimize early-stage complexity while positioning for international growth.

**Phase 1: Bulgarian Startup (Months 11-18)**
- Low-cost incorporation
- Favorable tax environment (10% corporate tax)
- Familiar legal system
- Focus on product development

**Phase 2: Lithuanian Scale-Up (Months 18-24)**
- Crypto-friendly jurisdiction
- EU single market access
- Superior banking infrastructure for crypto businesses
- Enhanced credibility with international merchants

### Legal Classification

**Protocol Classification:**
- Software as a Service (SaaS) platform
- Technology infrastructure provider
- Non-custodial payment protocol
- NOT a Payment Institution or Electronic Money Institution

**Rationale:**
Protocol never holds custody of funds. All transfers occur directly between customers and merchants via smart contracts on public blockchains. The business model is licensing access to software infrastructure, not processing payments.

---

## Phase 1: Bulgarian Entity (Months 11-18)

### Entity Type: EOOD

**EOOD (Еднолично дружество с ограничена отговорност)**
- English: Single-Member Limited Liability Company
- Equivalent to: Single-member LLC (US), Private Limited Company (UK)

```

**Step 2: Document Preparation**

Required documents:

---

## Co-Founder Integration

### When to Add Co-Founder

**Optimal Timing:**

Not in the beginning. Recommended timeline:
- **Months 12-18:** Product validated, early traction (50-100 merchants)
- Founder has built MVP alone
- Clear need for complementary skills
- Business model proven

**Rationale:**
- Early co-founder relationship carries high risk
- Solo founder retains maximum control during uncertain early phase
- Equity is too valuable to give away before product-market fit
- Easier to find right co-founder when you have traction

### Co-Founder Profile

**Ideal Co-Founder Characteristics:**

Skills needed (technical is already covered):
- Marketing and growth expertise
- Sales and business development
- Crypto industry network
- Previous startup experience
- Communication skills
- Hustler mentality

Red flags:
- Wants 50/50 split without equivalent contribution
- No relevant experience
- Doesn't understand the product
- Poor communication
- Misaligned values or vision
- Not committed full-time

### Equity Split Framework

**Recommended Splits:**

**Early Co-Founder (Months 12-15):**
```
Founder (technical, built MVP): 60-70%
Co-Founder (growth, joins validated product): 30-40%

Rationale:
- Founder took all initial risk
- Built entire protocol solo
- Created all intellectual property
- Co-founder joins de-risked venture
```

**Later Co-Founder (Months 18-24):**
```
Founder: 70-80%
Co-Founder: 20-30%

Rationale:
- Product is proven
- Revenue established
- Even less risk for co-founder
```

**Advisor/Part-Time Partner:**
```
Founder: 85-90%
Advisor: 10-15%

Rationale:
- Not full-time involvement
- Advisory capacity
- Specific expertise contribution
```

### Vesting Structure

**Critical: Vesting Prevents Co-Founder from Leaving Early with Equity**

**Standard Structure:**
```
4-year vesting with 1-year cliff

Year 0-1 (cliff): 0% vested
- If co-founder leaves before 12 months: receives 0%

Year 1: 25% vests (on cliff date)
Year 2: 50% total vested (25% in year 2)
Year 3: 75% total vested (25% in year 3)
Year 4: 100% fully vested (25% in year 4)

Monthly vesting after cliff:
- After month 12: additional 2.08% per month (25%/12)
```

**Example Scenarios:**
```
Co-founder allocated: 30% equity with 4-year vesting

Scenario 1: Leaves after 6 months
- Vested: 0% (before cliff)
- Receives: 0%

Scenario 2: Leaves after 18 months
- Vested: 25% (cliff) + 6 months × 2.08% = 37.5% of allocation
- Receives: 11.25% total company equity (37.5% of 30%)

Scenario 3: Stays 4 years
- Vested: 100% of allocation
- Receives: 30% total company equity
```

### Legal Documentation

**Essential Agreements:**

**1. Shareholders Agreement**

Must include:
- Ownership structure and percentages
- Vesting schedule with cliff
- Roles and responsibilities
- Decision-making process (ordinary vs major decisions)
- Non-compete clause (2 years standard)
- Intellectual property assignment
- Drag-along and tag-along rights
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Good leaver / bad leaver provisions

**2. Employment or Service Agreement**

Details:
- Job title and responsibilities
- Compensation (if any salary)
- Working hours and expectations
- Termination conditions
- Confidentiality obligations

**3. IP Assignment Agreement**

Ensures:
- All work created belongs to company
- No personal IP claims on protocol
- Applies to both founders equally

**4. Non-Compete and Non-Solicit**

Restrictions:
- Duration: 2 years post-departure
- Geographic scope: Worldwide (for software)
- Activity: Cannot start competing protocol
- Non-solicit: Cannot hire company employees or poach merchants

### Implementation Process

**Step-by-Step:**

**Month 12-15: Search and Evaluation**
1. Define ideal co-founder profile
2. Network within crypto community
3. Interview candidates
4. Evaluate culture fit and skills
5. Trial project (1-2 months working together)

**Month 15-16: Negotiation**
1. Discuss equity split
2. Agree on roles and responsibilities
3. Define vesting terms
4. Set expectations and goals

**Month 16: Legal Execution**
1. Engage lawyer to draft agreements
2. Review and negotiate terms
3. Sign shareholders agreement
4. Sign employment agreement
5. Sign IP assignment
6. Update company structure

**Month 17: Onboarding**
1. Transfer knowledge
2. Grant system access
3. Introduce to merchants and partners
4. Define OKRs for next 12 months
5. Establish regular communication cadence

**Bulgarian EOOD to Bulgarian OOD Conversion:**

When adding co-founder in Bulgaria:
```
Process:
1. EOOD (single owner) converts to OOD (multiple owners)
2. Notary act required
3. Update registration at Commercial Register
4. New articles of association
5. Share transfer documents

Cost: ~300-500 EUR
Timeline: 2-3 weeks
```

**Lithuanian UAB (simpler):**

UAB supports multiple shareholders by default:
```
Process:
1. Board resolution to issue shares
2. Share purchase agreement
3. Update at Centre of Registers
4. Tax filing (if applicable)

Cost: ~200-300 EUR
Timeline: 1-2 weeks
```

### Smart Contract Integration

**FeeCollector Update:**

When co-founder joins, update fee distribution:
```solidity
// Initial: Solo founder
owners = [founder]
percentages = [10000] // 100%

// After co-founder (70/30 split)
owners = [founder, cofounder]
percentages = [7000, 3000]

// Update via governance proposal
proposePercentageChange([founder, cofounder], [7000, 3000])

// Both approve
founder.approve(proposalId)
cofounder.approve(proposalId)

// Executed automatically when all owners approve
```

**On-chain transparency:**
- Fee split visible to anyone
- Automatic distribution
- No manual calculations
- No disputes possible

---

## Tax Strategy

### Revenue Recognition

**How Revenue is Generated:**

Protocol earns 1% fee on all payments:
- Native token payments: 1% in ETH/BNB/MATIC
- Token payments: 1% in USDC/USDT/DAI

**Revenue Flow:**
```
Customer pays → Merchant receives 99% → FeeCollector receives 1%
```

### Tax Treatment in Bulgaria

**Option A: Convert to Fiat Monthly (Recommended)**

Process:
```
1. Monthly: Withdraw fees from FeeCollector to company wallet
2. Transfer to exchange (Binance, Kraken)
3. Sell crypto for EUR
4. Transfer EUR to company bank account
5. Declare as revenue in accounting

Example:
Collected: 10,000 USDC in fees
Sell for: 9,950 EUR (after exchange fees)
Declare: 9,950 EUR revenue
Tax (10%): 995 EUR
```

**Option B: Hold in Crypto (Complex)**

Process:
```
1. Declare crypto as revenue at fair market value on receipt date
2. Pay tax on declared amount
3. Hold crypto as company asset
4. Report gains/losses on eventual sale

Problem: Must pay tax without converting to fiat
Solution: Sell portion to cover tax liability
```

**Recommendation:** Option A for simplicity and compliance

### Tax Treatment in Lithuania

**Same options available:**

Advantage of Lithuanian structure:
```
Reinvestment scenario:
Revenue: 100,000 EUR
Tax if reinvested: 0 EUR
Full amount available for operations

Vs Bulgaria:
Revenue: 100,000 EUR
Tax: 10,000 EUR (even if reinvested)
Available: 90,000 EUR
```

**For growth phase:** Lithuanian structure provides 10% more capital

### Tax Optimization Strategies

**Legitimate Expense Deductions:**

Deductible business expenses:
- Server and infrastructure costs
- Software licenses and tools
- Accounting and legal fees
- Marketing and advertising
- External audits and security reviews
- Business travel
- Office costs
- Employee salaries
- Contractor payments
- Insurance

**Example Optimization:**
```
Revenue: 100,000 EUR

Scenario A: Minimal Expenses
Expenses: 10,000 EUR
Taxable: 90,000 EUR
Tax (10%): 9,000 EUR
Net: 81,000 EUR

Scenario B: Legitimate Business Expenses
Expenses: 40,000 EUR
- Infrastructure: 5,000 EUR
- Marketing: 15,000 EUR
- Audit: 5,000 EUR
- Legal: 3,000 EUR
- Accounting: 2,000 EUR
- Insurance: 5,000 EUR
- Travel: 5,000 EUR
Taxable: 60,000 EUR
Tax (10%): 6,000 EUR
Net: 54,000 EUR

Savings: 3,000 EUR (but invested in business growth)
```

**Key Principle:** Only deduct legitimate business expenses. Aggressive optimization creates audit risk.

### International Tax Considerations

**VAT Treatment:**

**B2B Software Services:**
- Reverse charge mechanism
- Customer pays VAT in their country
- No Bulgarian/Lithuanian VAT due
- Must verify customer VAT number

**B2C Software Services:**
- Charged at customer's location rate (EU OSS scheme)
- Or at seller's location rate (if below threshold)

**Practical Impact:** Minimal VAT liability for B2B focus

**Transfer Pricing:**

If operating in multiple jurisdictions:
- Transactions between entities must be arm's length
- Document pricing rationale
- Avoid artificial profit shifting
- Consult tax advisor for complex structures
